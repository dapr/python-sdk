# Dapr SDK for Python

[Dapr](https://github.com/dapr/docs/tree/master/concepts#dapr-concepts) is a portable, event-driven, serverless runtime for building distributed applications across cloud and edge.

Dapr SDK for Python allows you to implement the [Virtual Actor model](https://github.com/dapr/docs/tree/master/concepts/actors), based on the actor design pattern. This SDK can run locally, in a container and in any distributed systems environment.

This includes the following packages:

* [dapr.actor](./dapr/actor): Actor Framework
* [dapr.clients](./dapr/clients): Dapr clients for Dapr building blocks
* [dapr.conf](./dapr/conf): Configuration
* [dapr.serializers](./dapr/serializers): serializer/deserializer
* [dapr.proto](./dapr/proto): Dapr gRPC autogenerated gRPC clients
* [flask_dapr](./flask_dapr): flask extension for Dapr

## Status
