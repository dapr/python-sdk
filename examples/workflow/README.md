# Workflow Examples

This directory contains examples of using the [Dapr Workflow](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/workflow/) extension. You can find additional information about these examples in the [Dapr Workflow Application Patterns docs](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/workflow/workflow-patterns#tabs-0-python).

## Prerequisites

- [Dapr CLI and initialized environment](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started)
- [Install Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Install requirements

You can install dapr SDK package using pip command:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the samples

Each of the examples in this directory can be run directly from the command line.

### Simple Workflow
This example represents a workflow that manages counters through a series of activities and child workflows.
It shows several Dapr Workflow features including:
- Basic activity execution with counter increments
- Retryable activities with configurable retry policies
- Child workflow orchestration with retry logic
- External event handling with timeouts
- Workflow state management (pause/resume)
- Activity error handling and retry backoff
- Global state tracking across workflow components
- Workflow lifecycle management (start, pause, resume, purge)

<!--STEP
name: Run the simple workflow example
expected_stdout_lines:
  - "== APP == Hi Counter!"
  - "== APP == New counter value is: 1!"
  - "== APP == New counter value is: 11!"
  - "== APP == Retry count value is: 0!"
  - "== APP == Retry count value is: 1! This print statement verifies retry"
  - "== APP == Appending 1 to child_orchestrator_string!"
  - "== APP == Appending a to child_orchestrator_string!"
  - "== APP == Appending a to child_orchestrator_string!"
  - "== APP == Appending 2 to child_orchestrator_string!"
  - "== APP == Appending b to child_orchestrator_string!"
  - "== APP == Appending b to child_orchestrator_string!"
  - "== APP == Appending 3 to child_orchestrator_string!"
  - "== APP == Appending c to child_orchestrator_string!"
  - "== APP == Appending c to child_orchestrator_string!"
  - "== APP == Get response from hello_world_wf after pause call: SUSPENDED"
  - "== APP == Get response from hello_world_wf after resume call: RUNNING"
  - "== APP == New counter value is: 111!"
  - "== APP == New counter value is: 1111!"
  - "== APP == Workflow completed! Result: Completed"
timeout_seconds: 30
-->

```sh
dapr run --app-id wf-simple-example --dapr-grpc-port 50001 -- python3 simple.py
```
<!--END_STEP-->

The output of this example should look like this:

```
 - "== APP == Hi Counter!"
  - "== APP == New counter value is: 1!"
  - "== APP == New counter value is: 11!"
  - "== APP == Retry count value is: 0!"
  - "== APP == Retry count value is: 1! This print statement verifies retry"
  - "== APP == Appending 1 to child_orchestrator_string!"
  - "== APP == Appending a to child_orchestrator_string!"
  - "== APP == Appending a to child_orchestrator_string!"
  - "== APP == Appending 2 to child_orchestrator_string!"
  - "== APP == Appending b to child_orchestrator_string!"
  - "== APP == Appending b to child_orchestrator_string!"
  - "== APP == Appending 3 to child_orchestrator_string!"
  - "== APP == Appending c to child_orchestrator_string!"
  - "== APP == Appending c to child_orchestrator_string!"
  - "== APP == Get response from hello_world_wf after pause call: SUSPENDED"
  - "== APP == Get response from hello_world_wf after resume call: RUNNING"
  - "== APP == New counter value is: 111!"
  - "== APP == New counter value is: 1111!"
  - "== APP == Workflow completed! Result: Completed"
```

### Task Chaining

This example demonstrates how to chain "activity" tasks together in a workflow. You can run this sample using the following command:
<!--STEP
name: Run the task chaining example
expected_stdout_lines:
  - "== APP == Step 1: Received input: 42."
  - "== APP == Step 2: Received input: 43."
  - "== APP == Step 3: Received input: 86."
  - "== APP == Workflow completed! Status: WorkflowStatus.COMPLETED"
timeout_seconds: 30
-->

```sh
dapr run --app-id wfexample --dapr-grpc-port 50001 -- python3 task_chaining.py
```
<!--END_STEP-->

The output of this example should look like this:

```
== APP == Workflow started. Instance ID: b716208586c24829806b44b62816b598
== APP == Step 1: Received input: 42.
== APP == Step 2: Received input: 43.
== APP == Step 3: Received input: 86.
== APP == Workflow completed! Status: WorkflowStatus.COMPLETED
```

### Fan-out/Fan-in

This example demonstrates how to fan-out a workflow into multiple parallel tasks, and then fan-in the results of those tasks. You can run this sample using the following command:

<!--STEP
name: Run the fan-out/fan-in example
match_order: none
expected_stdout_lines:
  - "== APP == Processing work item: 1."
  - "== APP == Processing work item: 2."
  - "== APP == Processing work item: 3."
  - "== APP == Processing work item: 4."
  - "== APP == Processing work item: 5."
  - "== APP == Processing work item: 6."
  - "== APP == Processing work item: 7."
  - "== APP == Processing work item: 8."
  - "== APP == Processing work item: 9."
  - "== APP == Processing work item: 10."
  - "== APP == Work item 1 processed. Result: 2."
  - "== APP == Work item 2 processed. Result: 4."
  - "== APP == Work item 3 processed. Result: 6."
  - "== APP == Work item 4 processed. Result: 8."
  - "== APP == Work item 5 processed. Result: 10."
  - "== APP == Work item 6 processed. Result: 12."
  - "== APP == Work item 7 processed. Result: 14."
  - "== APP == Work item 8 processed. Result: 16."
  - "== APP == Work item 9 processed. Result: 18."
  - "== APP == Work item 10 processed. Result: 20."
  - "== APP == Final result: 110."
timeout_seconds: 30
-->

```sh
dapr run --app-id wfexample --dapr-grpc-port 50001 -- python3 fan_out_fan_in.py
```
<!--END_STEP-->

The output of this sample should look like this:

```
== APP == Workflow started. Instance ID: 2e656befbb304e758776e30642b75944
== APP == Processing work item: 1.
== APP == Processing work item: 2.
== APP == Processing work item: 3.
== APP == Processing work item: 4.
== APP == Processing work item: 5.
== APP == Processing work item: 6.
== APP == Processing work item: 7.
== APP == Processing work item: 8.
== APP == Processing work item: 9.
== APP == Processing work item: 10.
== APP == Work item 1 processed. Result: 2.
== APP == Work item 2 processed. Result: 4.
== APP == Work item 3 processed. Result: 6.
== APP == Work item 4 processed. Result: 8.
== APP == Work item 5 processed. Result: 10.
== APP == Work item 6 processed. Result: 12.
== APP == Work item 7 processed. Result: 14.
== APP == Work item 8 processed. Result: 16.
== APP == Work item 9 processed. Result: 18.
== APP == Work item 10 processed. Result: 20.
== APP == Final result: 110.
```

Note that the ordering of the work-items is non-deterministic since they are all running in parallel.

### Human Interaction

This example demonstrates how to use a workflow to interact with a human user. This example requires input from the user, so you'll need to have a separate command for the Dapr CLI and the Python app.

The Dapr CLI can be started using the following command:

```sh
dapr run --app-id wfexample --dapr-grpc-port 50001
```

In a separate terminal window, run the following command to start the Python workflow app:

```sh
 python3 human_approval.py
 ```

When you run the example, you will see output as well as a prompt like this:

```
*** Requesting approval from user for order: namespace(cost=2000, product='MyProduct', quantity=1)
Press [ENTER] to approve the order...
```

Press the `ENTER` key to continue the workflow. If `ENTER` is pressed before the hardcoded timeout expires, then the following output will be displayed:

```
*** Placing order: namespace(cost=2000, product='MyProduct', quantity=1)
Workflow completed! Result: "Approved by 'Me'"
```

However, if the timeout expires before `ENTER` is pressed, then the following output will be displayed:

```
*** Workflow timed out!
```

### Monitor

This example demonstrates how to eternally running workflow that polls an endpoint to detect service health events. This example requires input from the user, so you'll need to have a separate command for the Dapr CLI and the Python app.

The Dapr CLI can be started using the following command:

```sh
dapr run --app-id wfexample --dapr-grpc-port 50001
```

In a separate terminal window, run the following command to start the Python workflow app:

```sh
python3 monitor.py
```

The workflow runs forever, or until the app is stopped. While it is running, it will periodically report information about whether a "job" is healthy or unhealthy. After several minutes, the output of this workflow will look something like this (note that the healthy and unhealthy message ordering is completely random):

```
Press Enter to stop...
Job 'job1' is healthy.
Job 'job1' is healthy.
Job 'job1' is unhealthy.
*** Alert: Job 'job1' is unhealthy!
Job 'job1' is healthy.
Job 'job1' is healthy.
Job 'job1' is healthy.
Job 'job1' is unhealthy.
*** Alert: Job 'job1' is unhealthy!
Job 'job1' is unhealthy.
```

This workflow runs forever or until you press `ENTER` to stop it. Starting the app again after stopping it will cause the same workflow instance to resume where it left off.

### Child Workflow

This example demonstrates how to call a child workflow. The Dapr CLI can be started using the following command:

```sh
dapr run --app-id wfexample --dapr-grpc-port 50001
```

In a separate terminal window, run the following command to start the Python workflow app:

```sh
python3 child_workflow.py
```

When you run the example, you will see output like this:
```
...
*** Calling child workflow 29a7592a1e874b07aad2bb58de309a51-child
*** Child workflow 6feadc5370184b4998e50875b20084f6 called
...
```


### Cross-app Workflow

This example demonstrates how to call child workflows and activities in different apps. The multiple Dapr CLI instances can be started using the following commands:

<!-- STEP
name: Run apps
expected_stdout_lines:
  - '== APP == app1 - triggering app1 workflow'
  - '== APP == app1 - received workflow call'
  - '== APP == app1 - triggering app2 workflow'
  - '== APP == app2 - received workflow call'
  - '== APP == app2 - triggering app3 activity'
  - '== APP == app3 - received activity call'
  - '== APP == app3 - returning activity result'
  - '== APP == app2 - received activity result'
  - '== APP == app2 - returning workflow result'
  - '== APP == app1 - received workflow result'
  - '== APP == app1 - returning workflow result'
background: true
sleep: 5
-->

```sh
pip install ./ext/dapr-ext-workflow
dapr run --app-id wfexample3 --dapr-grpc-port 50003 python3 cross-app3.py &
dapr run --app-id wfexample2 --dapr-grpc-port 50002 python3 cross-app2.py &
dapr run --app-id wfexample1 --dapr-grpc-port 50001 python3 cross-app1.py
```
<!-- END_STEP -->

When you run the apps, you will see output like this:
```
...
app1 - triggering app2 workflow
app2 - triggering app3 activity
...
```
among others. This shows that the workflow calls are working as expected.
