The Dapr actor package allows you to interact with Dapr virtual actors from a Python application.

## Pre-requisites

- [Dapr CLI]({{< ref install-dapr-cli.md >}}) installed
- Initialized [Dapr environment]({{< ref install-dapr-selfhost.md >}})
- [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed
- [Dapr Python package]({{< ref "python#installation" >}}) installed

## Actor interface

The interface defines the actor contract that is shared between the actor implementation and the clients calling the actor. Because a client may depend on it, it typically makes sense to define it in an assembly that is separate from the actor implementation.

```python
from dapr.actor import ActorInterface, actormethod

class DemoActorInterface(ActorInterface):
    @actormethod(name="GetMyData")
    async def get_my_data(self) -> object:
        ...
```

## Actor services

An actor service hosts the virtual actor. It is implemented a class that derives from the base type `Actor` and implements the interfaces defined in the actor interface.

Actors can be created using one of the Dapr actor extensions:
   - [FastAPI actor extension]({{< ref python-fastapi.md >}})
   - [Flask actor extension]({{< ref python-flask.md >}})

## Actor client

An actor client contains the implementation of the actor client which calls the actor methods defined in the actor interface.

```python
import asyncio

from dapr.actor import ActorProxy, ActorId
from demo_actor_interface import DemoActorInterface

async def main():
    # Create proxy client
    proxy = ActorProxy.create('DemoActor', ActorId('1'), DemoActorInterface)

    # Call method on client
    resp = await proxy.GetMyData()
```

## Sample

## Mock Actor Testing

The Dapr Python SDK provides the ability to create mock actors to unit test your actor methods and see how they interact with the actor state.

### Sample Usage 


```
from dapr.actor.runtime.mock_actor import create_mock_actor

class MyActor(Actor, MyActorInterface):
    async def save_state(self, data) -> None:
        await self._state_manager.set_state('mystate', data)
        await self._state_manager.save_state()

mock_actor = create_mock_actor(MyActor, "id")

await mock_actor.save_state(5)
assert mockactor._state_manager._mock_state['mystate'] == 5 #True
```
Mock actors are created by passing your actor class and an actor ID (a string) to the create_mock_actor function. This function returns an instance of the actor with many internal methods overridden. Instead of interacting with Dapr for tasks like saving state or managing timers, the mock actor uses in-memory state to simulate these behaviors.

This state can be accessed through the following variables:

**IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to type hinting issues as discussed further down, these variables will not be visible to type hinters/linters/etc, who will think they are invalid variables. You will need to use them with #type: ignore in order to satisfy any such systems.**

- **_state_manager._mock_state()**  
A `[str, object]` dict where all the actor state is stored. Any variable saved via `_state_manager.save_state(key, value)`, or any other statemanager method is stored in the dict as that key, value pair. Any value loaded via `try_get_state` or any other statemanager method is taken from this dict.

- **_state_manager._mock_timers()**  
A `[str, ActorTimerData]` dict which holds the active actor timers. Any actor method which would add or remove a timer adds or pops the appropriate `ActorTimerData` object from this dict.

- **_state_manager._mock_reminders()**  
A [str, ActorReminderData] dict which holds the active actor reminders. Any actor method which would add or remove a timer adds or pops the appropriate ActorReminderData object from this dict.

**Note: The timers and reminders will never actually trigger. The dictionaries exist only so methods that should add or remove timers/reminders can be tested. If you need to test the callbacks they should activate, you should call them directly with the appropriate values:**
```
result = await mock_actor.recieve_reminder(name, state, due_time, period, _ttl)
# Test the result directly or test for side effects (like changing state) by querying `_state_manager._mock_state`
```

### Usage and Limitations

**To allow for more fine-grained control, the `_on_activate` method will not be called automatically the way it is when Dapr initializes a new Actor instance. You should call it manually as needed as part of your tests.**

The `__init__`, `register_timer`, `unregister_timer`, `register_reminder`, `unregister_reminder` methods are all overwritten by the MockActor class that gets applied as a mixin via `create_mock_actor`. If your actor itself overwrites these methods, those modifications will themselves be overwritten and the actor will likely not behave as you expect.

*note: `__init__` is a special case where you are expected to define it as*
```
    def __init__(self, ctx, actor_id):
        super().__init__(ctx, actor_id)
```
*Mock actors work fine with this, but if you have added any extra logic into `__init__`, it will be overwritten. It is worth noting that the correct way to apply logic on initialization is via `_on_activate` (which can also be safely used with mock actors) instead of `__init__`.*

*If you have an actor which does override default Dapr actor methods, you can create a custom subclass of the MockActor class (from MockActor.py) which implements whatever custom logic you have along with interacting with `_mock_state`, `_mock_timers`, and `_mock_reminders` as normal, and then applying that custom class as a mixin via a `create_mock_actor` function you define yourself.*

The actor `_runtime_ctx` variable is set to None. All the normal actor methods have been overwritten such as to not call it, but if your code itself interacts directly with `_runtime_ctx`, tests may fail.

The actor _state_manager is overwritten with an instance of `MockStateManager`. This has all the same methods and functionality of the base `ActorStateManager`, except for using the various `_mock` variables for storing data instead of the `_runtime_ctx`. If your code implements its own custom state manager it will be overwritten and tests will likely fail.

### Type Hinting

Because of Python's lack of a unified method for type hinting type intersections (see: [python/typing #213](https://github.com/python/typing/issues/213)), type hinting unfortunately doesn't work with Mock Actors. The return type is type hinted as "instance of Actor subclass T" when it should really be type hinted as "instance of MockActor subclass T" or "instance of type intersection `[Actor subclass T, MockActor]`" (where, it is worth noting, `MockActor` is itself a subclass of `Actor`).

This means that, for example, if you hover over `mockactor._state_manager` in a code editor, it will come up as an instance of ActorStateManager (instead of MockStateManager), and various IDE helper functions (like VSCode's `Go to Definition`, which will bring you to the definition of ActorStateManager instead of MockStateManager) won't work properly.

For now, this issue is unfixable, so it's merely something to be noted because of the confusion it might cause. If in the future it becomes possible to accurately type hint cases like this feel free to open an issue about implementing it.
