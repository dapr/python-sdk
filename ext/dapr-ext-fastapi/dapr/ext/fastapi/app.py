        Subscribes to a topic on a pub/sub component.

        Subscriptions made through this method will show up when you GET /dapr/subscribe.

        Example:
            The following sample demonstrates how to use the subscribe method to register an
            event handler for the application on a pub/sub component named `pubsub`.

            >> from fastapi import Body, FastAPI
            >> from dapr.ext.fastapi import DaprApp

            >> app = FastAPI()
            >> dapr_app = DaprApp(app)
            >> @dapr_app.subscribe(pubsub='pubsub', topic='some_topic', route='/some_endpoint')
            >> def my_event_handler(event_data = Body()):
            >>    print(event_data)

        Args:
            pubsub: The name of the pub/sub component.
            topic: The name of the topic.
            metadata: The metadata for the subscription.
            route:
                The HTTP route to register for the event subscription. By default we'll
                generate one that matches the pattern /events/{pubsub}/{topic}. You can
                override this with your own route.
            dead_letter_topic: The name of the dead letter topic to use for the subscription.

        Returns:
            The decorator for the function.
